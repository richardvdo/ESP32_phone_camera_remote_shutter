**ESP32_phone_camera_remote_shutter**

The only thing it does is described in the header. Although there are a view tweakable parameters in settings.h.
Tested with Open Camera on Android 8.0.
It possible works with IPhone either.

### How does it work?
1. If you haven't done yet, install [Open Camera](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.opencamera) App on your Android device.
2. On your smartphone, turn Bluetooth on.
3. Switch on the ESP32 gadget.
4. Wait for it and confirm the connection.
5. It enumerates as HID keyboard device.
6. If you push the button on your self made remote control, it sends a keystroke to your phone, hence the shutter triggers.

### Wiring:
Due to its simplicity, there is no wiring diagram or schematic. Just have a look at [this picture](https://github.com/michaelruck/ESP32_phone_camera_remote_shutter/blob/master/images/BLE_Shutter_button_v1.0.jpg).
